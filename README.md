# vuesax-next (v4.x)

  <img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charles9904/vuesax-next/master/public/vuesax.gif" alt="vuesax" />

This is a fork of the [VueSax](https://github.com/lusaxweb/vuesax-next) project, an open-source UI framework for Vue.js based on the Material Design guidelines. Our goal is to continue maintaining and improving the framework, even though the original project has not been updated since 2020.

Keep in mind that **Vuesax 4** is in **ALPHA** state and may have inconsistencies and problems that we are going to solve, for now we do not recommend using it for real projects only tests. We would love our users to test with Vuesax v4 to find bugs so we can fix them on the fly.

## ðŸš€ Get started

To use this version of VueSax in your project, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install github:charles9904/vuesax-next
```

You can then import the components you need in your Vue.js application:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueSax from '@your-username/vuesax'
import '@your-username/vuesax/dist/vuesax.css'

Vue.use(VueSax)
```

## Updates

Every day is being updated and working on **Vuesax 4**, we will announce each new component and significant improvement in our networks and [discord](https://discord.gg/6AZNXEa) channel, this in order to benefit from our own users and help us improve and test each component and function.

## What is still missing and is working

- Components and functions
- Examples in Codepen or Codesandbox
- RTL support
- Check the SSR support
- Easy starter in Vue-CLI 3
- Plugin for Nuxtjs
- vs-code helper plugin
- vuesax / types
